            Certain functionalities of MailTime require payment before you can
            use them (&ldquo;Subscriptions&rdquo;). Subscriptions can be
            purchased by paying an annual or monthly subscription fee.
            Subscription fees are charged at the beginning of the subscription
            and, such subscription renews automatically for an additional period
            equal in length to the expiring subscription term until you cancel
            it.

            We reserve the right to change the pricing structure for our
            Subscriptions. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing
            subscribers from those changes. If we need to change the prices for
            existing subscribers, we will give at least 30 days notice and will
            notify you via the email address used to create your MailTime
            Account or by posting a notice about changes on our App and Website
            themselves. Your continued use of the App after the price change
            becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed
            amount. MailTime offers two types of MailTime AI Unlimited
            subscriptions: Monthly and Yearly. If you need help regarding the

            changes before they become effective. The revised fees will not
            apply to your current subscription period, however, your continued
            use after the effective date of such change will constitute your
            agreement to pay the updated fees.

            PLEASE NOTE, if your local currency is different from the currency
